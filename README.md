Interesting things:

* [Node Red MQTT on the Raspberry Pi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxUTYzxIDns "Excellent introduction to Node-Red!")
* MongoDB: Several resources on the internets have a typo in the command to start MongoDB. The correct comand is: `sudo service mongodb start` (NOT `sudo service mongod start`).
